# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
**I feel semi condifent. I get the basics and how it works, but putting in the information myself has been more difficult**
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
**This felt bad haha. Some more unproductive struggling that I have had so far. The resources people sent in the group chat were very helpful and the videos from other teachers online. I am not used to not having any foundational knowledge, so this is taking some getting used to.**
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
**Going through this assignment again and practicing the challenges will help cement the knowledge. I will take some time after class to help tonight**
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
**Watching a few more videos online will help I think just my basic understanding. Watching people I realize is a big helper for me.**
